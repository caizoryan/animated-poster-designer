# animated-poster-designer
This an animated poster designer built in jquery. Even though its currently built in jquery the plan is to port it onto a framework/library such as Vue.js or React in order to make it easier to scale. 

Currently it supports the following:

### Typography
_Currently only one typeface is available, Acumin Pro_
- Font Size
- Tracking
- Font weight

### Transform
- The text boxes can be moved around using x and y values
- 2 text boxes appear on load and upto 3 more can be added

### Animation
- Custom svg can be used to create a background animation
- The amount of repetitions of the svg can be input

## Features to be added

### Typography
- Use sliders instead of values
- The ability to select different typefaces
- The ability to use Variable fonts

### Transform
- Delete Text boxes
- Ability to rotate text

### Color
- Change the background color
- Change the text color

### Graphics
- Add basic shapes or svg and edit their properties

### File
- Save your projects
- Export as an Image
- Export as a gif or video file

### Animation
- edit svg parameters (width, height, color)
- add more animations
- edit animation parameters (stagger, duration, rotation offset, delay)
- implement p5 to add more complex animations

## End Goal
The current version and project may be intended to create a poster designer however it could potentialy be used as a landing page designer for web with 'pretty animations' and 'cool effects'. Once more features are introduced it is also possible to incorporate a generative quality to the design either with or without the help of a possible grid system.
